# Analyzing-the-Applications-of-Transistors-Project

Transistors are the fundamental components of any modern electronic device. Composed of a semiconductor material that controls the current flow within the circuit, the transistor revolutionized electronics by allowing for a much smaller-scale implementation of circuits. The two main types of transistors are Bipolar Junction Transistors (BJTs) and Field-Effect Transistors (FETs). The main function of both transistors is to either act as a switch that can turn a circuit ON or OFF, or amplify a weak electrical signal. Operational amplifiers, or op-amps, are integrated circuits made up of transistors and designed to amplify voltage signals. This report uncovers a direct design approach to designing a bipolar transistor audio amplifier, generating a square and triangle signal using op-amps, and implementing logic gates using the CMOS transistor, a combination of PMOS and NMOS transistors. The design process includes theoretical analysis, circuit modeling, and simulation using MULTISIM software attempting to mimic practical implementation. We compare and contrast the theoretical designs with the practical simulation outcomes, examining signal fidelity, noise levels, and efficiency. Lastly, we conclude the report by highlighting the importance of simulation in predicting real-world performance and guiding effective circuit design.
